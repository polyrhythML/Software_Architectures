What is an ARCHITECTURE ==>

Architecture is the fundamental organization of a system embodied in its components, their relationships to each other
and to the environment, and the principles guiding its design and evolution.

SOFTWARE ARCHITECTURE VS DESIGN ==>

* Architecture is higher level of the description, structures and interactions in a system.
* Design is all about the organization of parts or the components of the system and the subsystems involved in making
the system.

ARCHITECTURE ==>

* An architecture defines a structure
* An architecture picks a core set of elements.
* An architecture captures early design decisions.
* An architecture manages the stakeholder's requirements.
* An architecture influences the organisation/project team's structure.
* An architecture is influenced by its environment.
* An architecture documents the system.

Why is Software Architecture is important?

* Architecture selects quality attributes to be optimized for a system.
* Architecture facilitates early prototyping.
* Architecture allows a system to be built component-wise.
* Architecture helps manage changes to the system.
* If no architecture is defined, it becomes difficult to produce a system which is extensible and modifiable, and would
not produce a system with a set of quality attributes quite far away from original requirements.

What are Architecture's quality attributes ?

A quality attribute is a measurable and testable property of a system which can be used to evaluate the performance of a
system within its prescribed environment with respect to its non-functional aspects.

* Modifiability
* Testability
* Scalability and performance
* Availability
* Security
* Deploy-ability
